# WinterTC

The Technical Committee on Web-interoperable Server Runtimes (a.k.a. WinterTC)
aims to provide a space for JS runtimes to collaborate on API interoperability
with each other and with the web.

This repository contains administrative information about the technical
committee.

WinterTC was initially started as a W3C Community Group called
[WinterCG](https://www.w3.org/community/wintercg/), but in December 2024 we
decided to move to Ecma. You can read the reasons for this move
[here](standardization). At the moment, this transition is still along the way,
so excuse some rough edges.

## Participating
