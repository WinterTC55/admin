## Joining the committee

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Meetings are private to committee members, but [agendas] and [minutes] are public.

Members are typically one of two categories: Delegates and Invited Experts.

- If you work for an [Ecma member organization][ecma-members]), you can [become a delegate][new-delegate] on behalf of
  your employer.
- If you don't work for an Ecma member, or your company is still exploring membership, you can participate by [becoming
  an invited expert][new-invited-expert].

If you have already joined the committee via one of these roles, you can find the link to join the call via the GitHub
organisation [members-only view][members-only]

For more information on WinterTC (TC55)'s scope and programme of work, see [the committee page][TC55] on Ecma's website.

WinterTC (TC55) was initially started as a W3C Community Group called [WinterCG], but in December 2024 decided to move
to Ecma. You can read the rationale for this move in the [standardization] document. All documents from the W3C
Community Group era are retained in the [WinterCG Archive][archive].
