## 1 Welcome, opening and meeting logistics

**Andreu Botella**, vice chair of TC55, began the teleconference and welcomed attendees. All attendees were informed that the meeting was recorded and transcribed by Google Gemini for the purpose of note-taking.

## 2 Approval of the minutes of the virtual meeting of 01 May 2025

Notes from the meeting matching the distributed Microsoft Word Document had been made into a GitHub Pull Request and was reviewed and approved by the attendees of the meeting.

## 3 Review of the agenda

The agenda was created from the comments on [the meeting’s associated GitHub issue](https://github.com/WinterTC55/admin/issues/117), as is the standard practice for TC55. It was proposed and approved at the start of the meeting.

* Review of the notes for last meeting ([Minutes of the 6th meeting of Ecma TC55, 01 May 2025 \#116](https://github.com/WinterTC55/admin/pull/116)) (5 min)
* Approval of this meeting's agenda
* Continue WPT review:
  * Not sure if there's much else to discuss here, since we'd probably need to finish combing through the spec for both fetch and events before we can review those WPT
  * Maybe FormData, event loop tests and the js WPT folder
* Continue going through the fetch spec
  * HTTP-redirect fetch, starting on step 15
* Discuss possible new additions to the Minimum Common API:
  * Observable ([Requesting a position on the Observable API proposal-minimum-common-api\#72](https://github.com/WinterTC55/proposal-minimum-common-api/issues/72)). This was raised last year, and we didn't discuss it much, but Chrome is now shipping it.
  * Sanitizer API ([Sanitizer API proposal-minimum-common-api\#87](https://github.com/WinterTC55/proposal-minimum-common-api/issues/87)).

## 4 Discussions

## 4.1 WPT Review

Outcomes of today’s discussion can be seen on the [WPT analysis tracking issue](https://github.com/WinterTC55/proposal-minimum-common-api/issues/86#issuecomment-2884169434).

### 4.1.1 File Systems & FormData

It isn’t yet clear what the best approach will be to accept FormData. Andreu has added [a TODO to the Minimum Common API specification](https://min-common-api.proposal.wintertc.org/#issue-92f53c35) and [an issue in the MCA proposal](https://github.com/WinterTC55/proposal-minimum-common-api/issues/63) to discuss more broadly. The catch is that WP tests typically require creating an HTMLFormElement in order to test the FormData, which server-side runtimes would not be expected to support. Some recent changes to WPT do appear to provide, if not a 1:1 test, at least code that can reliably be reused by MCA testing.

Constructor tests are challenging because existing runtimes already have their own behaviour depending on whether zero, one, or two arguments (un)defined.

### 4.1.2 Event loops

Due to a number of conflicting assumptions made about any given runtime’s event loops, not every server runtime is consistent in event management. **Andreu Botella** will go through the WPT and Fetch spec in finer detail between meetings and bring them on a future agenda.

### 4.1.3 JS Tests

There are a number of tests against the ECMAScript language itself, not just the Web Platform; **Andreu Botella** will research whether those were meant to be implemented in Test262.

## 4.2 Additions to Minimum Common API spec

### 4.2.1 Observable API

Chrome is now shipping Observable, so TC55 has run out of time to start making decisions about its place in the Minimum Common API. It’s a significant API to implement, and relies once again on a predictable event loop.

### 4.3 Sanitizer API

On the browser side, the Sanitizer API’s intended purpose is to prevent cross-site scripting vulnerabilities—making it clear to developers identifying “safe” and “unsafe” markup. It will work with ECMAScript TrustedTypes. It *may* be meaningful to developers working on server runtimes, but would require implementing DOM APIs. **Andreu Botella** & **Owen Buckley** will try to bring **J.S. Choi (invited expert)** in to participate in a future meeting to discuss.

## 4.3 Continuing on review of Fetch API

The committee continued through the Fetch API, with **Andreu Botella** updating [the tracking issue](https://github.com/WinterTC55/fetch-workstream/issues/1#issuecomment-2884343435). The review of HTTP-redirect was completed, and review of HTTP-network-or-cache was started, to be finished at a future meeting.

## 5 Any other business

The TC55 organization name has been updated to [WinterTC55](https://github.com/WinterTC55/), and the website theme is being updated to align better with Ecma orange #fc7c00.

## 6 Next meetings

The next meetings will take place as Google Meet video calls fortnightly. The next scheduled is on 29 May, 2025 at 16:30 CEST.

## 6.1 Past and Future Agendas

Agendas are built via GitHub issues in the WinterTC admin repo, and remain available in perpetuity.

## 7 Conclusion

The vice chair wrapped up the meeting and the call concluded.
