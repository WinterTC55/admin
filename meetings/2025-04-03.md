## 1     Welcome, opening and meeting logistics

**Andreu Botella**, vice chair of TC55, began the teleconference and welcomed attendees. All attendees were informed that the meeting was recorded and transcribed by Google Gemini for the purpose of note-taking.

## 2     Approval of the minutes of the virtual meeting of20 March 2025

The [pull request](https://github.com/wintercg/admin/pull/110) of the minutes from the 4th meeting of TC55 were acknowledged and approved.

## 3   Review of the agenda

The agenda was created from the comments on **[the meeting’s associated GitHub issue](https://github.com/wintercg/admin/issues/111)**, as is the standard practice for TC55. It was proposed and approved at the start of the meeting.

* Continue WPT review
  * `DOMException`
  * `Event`
  * `EventTarget`
* `Fetch`-related APIs (`Header`, `Request`, `Response`)
* WASM
* `globalThis`: `navigator`, `performance.now` `queueMicrotasks`, `setInterval`/`setTimeout`, `structuredClone`, `atob`/`btoa`

## 4     Discussions

### 4.1 Web Platform Test review

Andreu Botella picked up the WPT review where Luca Casonato left off at the 4th meeting of TC55. Andreu, with the support of the attendees, concluded that this review was best facilitated by Luca, who has been doing the bulk of the work between meetings.

### 4.2 Fetch Specification review

The committee continued on working through aspects of Fetch which will or will not be implemented by server-side runtimes.

#### 4.2.1 HTTP Extensions Headers (continued from previous meetings)

* context sniffing—the nosniff-related mimetype restrictions in the fetch API for browsers should not have any impact on a server-side implementation
* Cross-origin restrictions are not relevant to a server environment and will be ignored
* Sec-Purpose header is related to browser prefetch and will be ignored
 
#### 4.2.2 Accept Headers

* accept-language is not relevant without knowing the destination
 
#### 4.2.3 Main Fetch Algorithm

Andreu added [a comment](https://github.com/wintercg/fetch-workstream/issues/1#issuecomment-2776237976) to [the tracking issue](https://github.com/wintercg/fetch-workstream/issues/1) on the [fetch-workstream](https://github.com/wintercg/fetch-workstream/) repo to summarize review of the “main” fetch algorithm. Important open questions are primarily security-related; referrer, CSP, HSTS, CORS, “bad” ports, etc. The ports, specifically, are addressed in [a sub-issue](https://github.com/wintercg/fetch-workstream/issues/10) on the repo.

#### 4.2.4 Fetch response handover

There are some open questions about early steps which servers may not *need* to implement, but may wish to. This is also noted in [the comment on the tracking issue](https://github.com/wintercg/fetch-workstream/issues/1#issuecomment-2776237976) opened during the meeting.

## 5     Any other business

The next TC55 meeting conflicts with the next TC39 meeting. There is enough overlap in the two committees that it may be too difficult to do both. There is [an open GitHub issue](https://github.com/wintercg/admin/issues/109) to discuss.

## 6     Next meetings

The next meetings will take place as Google Meet video calls fortnightly. The next scheduled is on 16 April, see §5.

### 6.1     Past and Future Agendas

Agendas are built via GitHub issues in the WinterTC [admin repo](https://github.com/wintercg/admin/issues/), and remain available in perpetuity.

## 7     Conclusion

The vice-chair wrapped up the meeting and the call concluded.
