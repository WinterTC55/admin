## 1 Welcome, opening and meeting logistics

**Luca Casonato**, chair of TC55, began the teleconference and welcomed attendees. All attendees were informed that the meeting was recorded and transcribed by Google Gemini for the purpose of note-taking.

## 2 Approval of the minutes of the virtual meeting of03 April 2025

The minutes were not yet published, but notes from the meeting had been made into GitHub issues reviewed by the attendees of the meeting.

## 3 Review of the agenda

The agenda was created from the comments on ***the meeting’s associated GitHub issue***, as is the standard practice for TC55. It was proposed and approved at the start of the meeting.

* Introductions for the benefit of new participants
* The future of Runtime Keys (5 min)
* Continue WPT review: (30 min)
  * DOMException
  * Event
  * EventTarget
  * Fetch-related APIs (Header, Request, Response)
  * WASM
  * globalThis: navigator, performance.now queueMicrotask, setInterval/setTimeout, structuredClone, atob/btoa
* Continue going through the fetch spec (starting with [fetch response handover](https://fetch.spec.whatwg.org/#fetch-finale) algorithm, step 4) (30 mins)

## 4 Discussions

### 4.1 Future of Runtime Keys

**Ethan Arrowood** [brought a discussion](https://github.com/wintercg/runtime-keys/issues/23) of what to do next with the [Runtime Keys repository](https://github.com/wintercg/runtime-keys), now that TC55 has made the decision not to pursue publication of a registry within Ecma. The Package Metadata Interoperability group within the Open JS Foundation wants to collaborate with TC55 to shepherd this project to its next home, as all participants find its existence valuable. In the past, **James Snell** has suggested [IANA](https://www.iana.org/) as the right place for such a registry—**Ethan** will research what that process would involve. A note that **Jordan Harband** [disagrees](https://github.com/openjs-foundation/package-metadata-interoperability-collab-space/issues/35#issuecomment-2718652038) that a Runtime Keys registry is out of scope for TC55, but does support its move to IANA.

### 4.2 Web Platform Tests review

**Luca Casonato** returned to the [WPT Analysis GitHub issue](https://github.com/wintercg/proposal-minimum-common-api/issues/86#issuecomment-2845038320) to discuss each set of tests’ appropriateness for the Minimum Common API. See that link for a specific test names to be included or excluded relating to discussion below.

#### 4.2.1 Structured Clone

The Structured Clone test harness sometimes uses DOM APIs that are not part of the Minimum Common API to test various interactions. There is a [ShadowRealm-related WPT Pull Request](https://github.com/web-platform-tests/wpt/pull/49282) by Philip Chimento that **Andreu Botella** had reviewed but hasn't landed yet, which might make the entire harness be able to be fully run by WinterTC runtimes. More analysis is needed.

#### 4.2.2 DOMException

All DOMException tests appear compatible with the Minimum Common API

#### 4.2.3 Event & EventTarget

Events necessarily involve [bubbling](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/Scripting/Event_bubbling), which is fully reliant on the DOM. The majority of these tests will not run or pass in a server-side runtime. The committee will return to this topic in the future, with Events (and EventTargets) as their own timeboxed agenda item.

There was some discussion about writing a simplified version of the spec that removes bubbling, or documenting which parts are not relevant without bubbling, since they're mixed together with regular event dispatch machinery and it's not easy to tell them apart.

#### 4.2.4 WASM

All tests for WASM other than module serialization tests are appropriate for a server-side runtime and shall be included in MCApi compliance

#### 4.2.5 Navigator

Only `userAgent` is included in the Minimum Common API. **Andreu Botella** observes that there is only one relevant test, which tests that `navigator.userAgent` is used in XHR. This might be better moved to be a Fetch test. The chairs are ambivalent to its inclusion and will return to make a decision at a future time.

#### 4.2.6 Performance.now

Tests within the WPT that act on performance.now are found under hr-time, specifically the idlharness, basic, and monotonic clock test.

#### 4.2.7 microtasks

The `[queue-microtask-exceptions.any.js](https://github.com/web-platform-tests/wpt/blob/master/html/webappapis/microtask-queuing/queue-microtask-exceptions.any.js)` test relies on the `error` event being fired on the global object. This is something we [decided to add to the Minimum Common API](https://github.com/wintercg/proposal-minimum-common-api/pull/82), but which Node.js does not implement, and so they will not be able to run this test. Andreu Botella believes Node.js's WPT test runner already patches things so they can run it.

#### 4.2.8 setInterval / setTimeout

These timers from html webapps should generally run in any environment, their tests will be included with the exception of tests relating to cross-realm behaviours.
#### 4.2.9 atob / btoa

These are straightforward functions that are expected to run across runtimes, the tests will be included.

### 4.2.10 Fetch tests

There’s no current suite of tests for Fetch that can be used for both server-side runtimes and browsers not due to what they are testing, but rather how they are testing it. Some tests will need to be rewritten for greater flexibility.

**Ethan Arrowood** suggested referencing [undici](https://github.com/nodejs/undici), which is an HTTP client written for Node.js that also builds on top of WPT for its testing. It has useful test fixtures and [expectations](https://github.com/nodejs/undici/blob/main/test/wpt/status/fetch.status.json) that may be adaptable for testing minimum common API compliance for Fetch.

### 4.2.11 Other WPT-related discussion

**Andreu Botella** brings up a concern that running some of these tests may not be compatible with implementations of workers in all runtimes (e.g. Deno only supports workers running an ESM module, rather than "classic" script workers), and suggests a future discussion of scope regarding testing classic workers vs module workers. **Luca Casonato** agrees about potential scope creep, and suggests returning to this conversation in a future attempt to publish “levels” of compliance, since workers are not currently included in the Minimum Common API.

### 4.4 Fetch spec

The committee continued its line-by-line [review of the Fetch specification](https://github.com/wintercg/fetch-workstream/issues/1#issuecomment-2845136268)

#### 4.4.1 fetch response handover

Runtimes will treat all requests as same-origin, generally skipping any filtering or similar behaviours. (This was discussed last meeting as well)

#### 4.4.2 scheme fetch

* `about:` scheme requests all fail, other than `about:blank`. **Andreu Botella** points out that some browsers use `about:` URLs for browser-internal resources, such as `about:version`, but this is handed during navigation and should never make it to the fetch algorithms.
* `blob:` requests will behave as initially described in the spec, but origin checking will be skipped.
* `file://` requests are implementation-defined in the spec. We might specify them when a filesystem level has been described for the minimum common API.

#### 4.4.3 http fetch

Various steps in this section are related to service workers or origin-relevant details (especially CORS). The steps most relevant to service workers will be discussed at a later date, when **James Snell** is able to attend the meeting. Generally origin-related steps are to be skipped, with the exception of subtle details in step 6, see the relevant comment on [the tracking issue](https://github.com/wintercg/fetch-workstream/issues/1#issuecomment-2845136268) for more information.

#### 4.4.4 http redirect fetch

Like much of the fetch specification, generally origin-related details can be skipped. However, step 13 is relevant to server-side runtimes to prevent passing authorization data to a different origin. Both Node.js and Deno have had CVEs opened in the past relating to this process.

## 5 Any other business

None.
