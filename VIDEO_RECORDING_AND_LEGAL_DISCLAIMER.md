# TC55 video recording, meeting minutes and legal disclaimer

During the TC meeting, a video recording (the built-in function of the video conferencing tool, currently Google Meet)
will be taken to aide in producing and publishing [minutes] afterward. The video file is deleted immediately upon the
opening of the minutes pull request by the secretary, and is not at any time made public. TC55 participants are
encouraged to review and modify minutes for accuracy before the following meeting, at which time the PR is merged. (A PR
can be made at any time; it is best to do so while the meeting is still fresh in the mind of the participants.)

Meeting participation is restricted to Delegates of Ecma Members and Invited Experts approved by the Ecma Secretariat.
Meeting minutes are available to anyone in tne public by navigating to the [`meetings`][minutes]directory of the
WinterTC55 admin repository on GitHub.
